## Blog Post 3: Final Solution

### In the culmination of my Automation Project, I introduce a Python script tailored for transforming colored images into black and white masterpieces. This script is a testament to efficiency and creativity in the realm of image processing.

#### [convert_to_black_and_white.py](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo/blob/main/convert_to_black_and_white.py)

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def convert_to_black_and_white(input_path, output_path):
    try:
        img = Image.open(input_path)

        bw_img = img.convert("L")

        bw_img.save(output_path)
        print(f"Image converted to black and white: {output_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {input_path}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_directory = 'Colored_Images'
    output_directory = 'Gray_Images'

    os.makedirs(output_directory, exist_ok=True)

    for filename in os.listdir(input_directory):
        if filename.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png')):
            input_path = os.path.join(input_directory, filename)
            output_path = os.path.join(output_directory, f"bw_{filename}")

            convert_to_black_and_white(input_path, output_path)
```

**How It Works:**
- The script leverages the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to open, process, and save images.
- For each image in the 'Colored_Images' directory, it converts the image to black and white.
- The resulting black and white images are then saved in the 'Gray_Images' directory with a filename prefix 'bw_'.

**Advantages:**
- Streamlines the process of converting a large number of colored images into black and white.
- Provides a structured approach by organizing the processed images in a separate directory.
- The script's simplicity ensures easy integration into different workflows.

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited customization options for the black and white conversion process.

This Python script empowers content creators and photographers by automating the conversion of colored images to black and white, adding a touch of artistic flair to their visual content. Stay tuned for further insights into the applications and impact of automation in my upcoming blog post.
